My portfolio

Based on the Stylish Portfolio by Start Bootstrap, and personally modified by me. This portfolio will be my learning/experimenting with HTML/CSS/JS thus being in a constant state of "Under Construction".

Cheers to Start Bootstrap for the [Stylish Portfolio](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/stylish-portfolio/).
